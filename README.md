# TheOfficeMachineLearning
This is a project I completed over a weekend with Anna Lai of Texas A&amp;M. It contains a frontend and backend of a machine learning algorithm that predicts the rating of a hypothetical season of "The Office" after receiving the number of lines per character for that season. Utilizes Python + sklearn, pandas, and Flask for the backend and CSSHTML for the frontend
